    subtitle: "This is an individual project of Course Data Analytics for Finance.
      \r\n    It is also my first time to create a website using R language. \r\n
      Not only does it provide a good opportunity for me to improve my proficiency in R language,
      but it also turns to be a fantastic journey to explore myself. \r\n   It is exciting to share 
      my stories, and hopefully you will meet a unique soul here."
