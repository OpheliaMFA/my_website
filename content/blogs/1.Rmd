***"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more; it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing",*** wrote by Shakespeare in *Macbeth*. What I believe is, as a shadow, I chase the light; at my stage, I am the only and the best player. There are many times we feel that life is meaningless, however, it is our responsibility to tell the tale of our life and define the meaning by ourselves.

Now, let me tell my tale to you:

My name is **Yao Li** and I come from Mainland, China. My hometown Zhangshu, known as the *Capital of Medicine, Wine and Salt*, is a small but beautiful and historical city located in the southeast part of the country. My family used to live by Gan River, a branch of the Yangtze River. When I was a child, I usually played with my friends on the shore, piling castles with sand, or imagining the future to the accompaniment of tide and sunset.

I was born curious and naughty, always with a strong passion to explore the world around. I love taking adventures, by myself or leading a group of kids, and do some "small experiments", which often resulted in my parents' complaints. However, in the summer when I was eight, I broadened my approach of exploration. I gradually realized there was an advanced way to build an understanding of this world which could help me escape the limits as a child. My uncle brought me to a bookstore and promised he would buy books for me as presents. This is when magic happened. More than twenty books of different genres and topics had accompanied me for the whole summer. I read novels such as *Jane Erye*, *The Lady of the Camellias* and *Les Mis√©rables*, history books such as *Five Thousand years of the World* and *Records of the Historian*, and adventure fictions such as *Vingt mille lieues sous les mers* and *Gulliver's Travels*.

Since then, I fell in love with reading and considered it as an important way that connects me to a wider world. At the same time, I also take trips elsewhere, both domestic and abroad, to see and feel the various environments and the culture there. I also write articles and stories to record my inspirations and observations, some of which even won national prizes. There was a time when I was in primary school, a friend of my father read my articles to the class he taught in high school, and none of his students believed they were written by a 12-year-old girl! 

Besides, I had also learnt *Erhu*, a traditional Chinese instrument, for seven years, and achieved the certificate of Level 10(highest) before my graduation from junior high school. This long process cultivated my interests in music. In addition to Chinese music, I love classic music as well. Bach, Brahms, Chopin, Debussy, Tchaikovsky...Their works always comfort my loneliness and heal my broken soul.

Then why didn't I just study literature or art?
