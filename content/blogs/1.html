<p><strong><em>“Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more; it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing”,</em></strong> wrote by Shakespeare in <em>Macbeth</em>. What I believe is, as a shadow, I chase the light; at my stage, I am the only and the best player. There are many times we feel that life is meaningless, however, it is our responsibility to tell the tale of our life and define the meaning by ourselves.</p>
<p>Now, let me tell my tale to you:</p>
<p>My name is <strong>Yao Li</strong> and I come from Mainland, China. My hometown Zhangshu, known as the <em>Capital of Medicine, Wine and Salt</em>, is a small but beautiful and historical city located in the southeast part of the country. My family used to live by Gan River, a branch of the Yangtze River. When I was a child, I usually played with my friends on the shore, piling castles with sand, or imagining the future to the accompaniment of tide and sunset.</p>

<p>I was born curious and naughty, always with a strong passion to explore the world around. I love taking adventures, by myself or leading a group of kids, and do some “small experiments”, which often resulted in my parents’ complaints. However, in the summer when I was eight, I broadened my approach of exploration. I gradually realized there was an advanced way to build an understanding of this world which could help me escape the limits as a child. My uncle brought me to a bookstore and promised he would buy books for me as presents. This is when magic happened. More than twenty books of different genres and topics had accompanied me for the whole summer. I read novels such as <em>Jane Erye</em>, <em>The Lady of the Camellias</em> and <em>Les Misérables</em>, history books such as <em>Five Thousand years of the World</em> and <em>Records of the Historian</em>, and adventure fictions such as <em>Vingt mille lieues sous les mers</em> and <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em>.</p>

<p>Since then, I fell in love with reading and considered it as an important way that connects me to a wider world. At the same time, I also take trips elsewhere, both domestic and abroad, to see and feel the various environments and the culture there. I also write articles and stories to record my inspirations and observations, some of which even won national prizes. There was a time when I was in primary school, a friend of my father read my articles to the class he taught in high school, and none of his students believed they were written by a 12-year-old girl!</p>
<p>Besides, I had also learnt <em>Erhu</em>, a traditional Chinese instrument, for seven years, and achieved the certificate of Level 10 (highest) before my graduation from junior high school. This long process cultivated my interests in music. In addition to Chinese music, I love classical music as well. Bach, Brahms, Chopin, Debussy, Tchaikovsky…Their works always comfort my loneliness and recollect my soul when it breaks into pieces.</p>

<p>But instead of literature or art, I chose finance as my major in university. This is because in the past, although I benefited a lot from them, immersing myself in these subjects all day made me a bit unrealistic and did not much develop my logical thinking. In the summer after my entrance exam, I talked to my cousin who worked in a hedge fund and used to be a research analyst, and through our chat I found doing investment not only requires strong quantitative ability and critical thinking, but you also need to draw insights from your research on industries and companies. The ultimate form of investment would be a kind of art, and a kind of philosophy that balances sense and sensitivity, and a brilliant investor definitely has a comprehensive understanding of human society and life. That really attracted me and I determined to study finance in Renmin University of China, which ranks top 1 in finance major in China and is known for its rigorous education, to complete myself by improving my rationality and connecting myself to more practical subjects.</p>

<p>Four-year study at Renmin had not only brought me a solid understanding of finance, markets and analytics, but also enabled me to gain diverse perspectives to analyze and solve issues. Now I am comfortable combining qualitative and quantitative approaches and learn to take advantage of my interdisciplinary knowledge to get innovative ideas. Apart from performing well in subjects related to finance, I continued developing myself in humanities and art areas by taking relevant electives and achieved great results.</p>
<p>I really appreciate my choice four years ago, and now as a MFA student at LBS, I am excited to start a new chapter of the tale of my life.</p>
