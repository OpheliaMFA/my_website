## United States - Shining Snow
When I was in high school, I took a winter exchange in the United States. After studying in a high school in Minnesota for one month, I took a study tour in the east coast. I was fascinated by the New York City, especially Manhattan. I dreamed of being a New Yorker at that time.

## Europe - Summer Pearls
In the summer of 2019, I traveled to Europe with my family. It was an impressive journey and many scenes still pop up in my mind from time to time. It was like going through an exciting film in person, a lingering dream.

## Hong Kong - A Moveable Feast
In the spring of 2020, I took a semester exchange in Hong Kong University. Hong Kong is a complex but charming city. The mixture of eastern and western culture creates a unique atmosphere which is open, inclusive and free.

## Mainland - Landscape of Magic
For Mainland, I prefer the natural sights. All mountains and rivers have their own beauty, history and ecosystem. Every time I explore a spot, I would feel my connection to the land.
