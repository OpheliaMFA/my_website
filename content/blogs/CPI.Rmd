title: How has the CPI and its components changed over the years?
---
- We find CPI components at FRED and pull all of the CPI components into a vector and get all data since January 1, 2000.
- Since the data is an index with various starting dates, we calculate the 12-month change by using the lag function, which means we are comparing the current monthâ€™s value with that 12 months ago lag (value, 12).
- Then we order the components so the higher the yearly change, the earlier does that component appear. We also add a geom_smooth() for each component to get a sense of the overall trend and colour the points according to whether yearly change was positive or negative.

```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```

- As the above graphs have too many sub-categories, we further choose a smaller subset of the components and only list the major categories (Housing, Transportation, Food and beverages, Medical care, Education and communication, Recreation, and Apparel), sorted according to their relative importance.
