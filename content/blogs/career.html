<h2>Career Plan</h2>
<p>When I read the book <em>The Old Man and The Sea</em> in my childhood for the first time, one sentence impressed me and always pops up in my mind since then. It says, <strong><em>my big fish must be somewhere</em></strong>. After I went to university and majored in finance, I gradually found that might have previewed my future career when I look at all the red and green numbers flashing on the screen. From my point of view, a great investor, similar to a great fisherman, is driven by courage, perseverance, and endurance. Dreaming of becoming such an expert, I hope to discover the law of fluctuation in the sea of global financial market as a portfolio manager, enabling more amateur investors to catch their own big fish.</p>
<p>In the short term, I want to continue learning and honing my craft in top investment banks or funds as an research analyst. Through this experience, I hope to gain sector-wide perspectives and develop a mature attitude towards deviation from expectations. To be a competitive candidate, not only will I devote myself to my studies at London Business School to advance my expertise and skills, but I will also seek opportunities to develop precise judgement and professional maturity. I believe that the MFA Programme will lay me a solid foundation for my career, which I already felt from our rigorous curriculums &gt;_&lt; and career development training.</p>
<p>After becoming an exceptional analyst, my goal is to build my own stock portfolio as a fund manager. To prepare myself, I will gather insights of research, analysis and valuation during my role as a research analyst. Additionally, a comprehensive understanding of main industries will allow me to make keen investment decisions. I will also establish connections with industry partners from various fields, including alumni of LBS, to exchange ideas with and benefit from their unique views about economics and markets.</p>
