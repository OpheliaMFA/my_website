## Biggest Achievement
- My biggest achievement up to now might be co-authoring the monograph of “Research on the Impact of Delayed Retirement on China's Labor Market and its Functional Mechanism”, a youth project of National Social Science Foundation in China. At that time, I was one of the research assistants for Dr. Liu, my lecturer of Macroeconomics in Renmin University of China as well as the former economist in International Monetary Fund. I was previously assigned an analysis on this topic, and it earned me an acknowledge from him, so he invited me to extend my analysis and shape it into several chapters for this monograph. 

- Although I had some knowledge in this field because of my analysis, actually this task was not less challenging as I had little experience in academic writing but a monograph is even more demanding. Besides, a monograph also requires wider and more in-depth contents. However, I managed to regard these challenges more as motivations instead of frustration. I tried my best to further search relevant information and statistics from multiple sources, think about the correlations and future trends, reach my conclusions by structures approaches and summarize them into chapters concisely and logically. And finally, these efforts made my name show on the co-author list as the only undergraduate.

- This experience had a major influence on me because it convinced me that you do not need to be "fully prepared" for everything. Before this project, I only took part in two academic research and lacked in relevant experience. However, it proves that success is a possibility only when you choose to begin.

## A challenge I am proud to overcome

- When I was seven, I started learning to play Erhu, which I mentioned in my biography. It is a traditional Chinese instrument, similar to violin but only with 2 strings. Although I was born with extraordinary pitch, there was a big challenge for me as my fingers are not long enough, especially my little finger. There were many times when I was playing music, I could not directly stretch my little finger to the specific position to press the string at the required time, leading to a large negative impact to my overall performance.

- That was really a nightmare. But I didn’t want to give up because I love Erhu so much. I told myself that there must be some ways for me to overcome this. And the way I figured out was to accelerate the speed of moving my fingers. Instead of directly stretching my little finger to the position and press the strings, which is nearly impossible, I trained myself to swiftly move my little finger there. In order to achieve the same effect, I had spent 1 more hour everyday to practice for seven years. And before my graduation from junior high school, I finally achieved the certificate of Level 10. I am really proud of overcoming this challenge and this experience always encourages me to pursue my goals regardless of potential difficulties.

## A feedback that has a profound impact on me

- “Have you ever considered studying PhD in finance?” It pops up in my mind so naturally when looking at this question and it still sounds impressive. It is said by Dr. Lu, my lecturer of international finance, after I completed my presentation on a paper written by Oliver Blanchard, a Nobel prize owner. 

- He further explained that my rebuttal to Blanchard’s points and the empirical evidence I provided were very refreshing and innovative. And he thought I definitely had the talents to develop expertise in academia of finance. That really shocked me because during college I have been mainly focusing on building my professional skillset by participating internships and relevant clubs, and I rarely worked on academic aspect. This presentation could even be counted as my first time to research on an academic paper, which was very challenging to me from the beginning.

- And this feedback really has a profound impact on me since then. I used to believe that people should focus on their strengths and achieve something they are already good at. But this experience largely changed my mind as I tend to think that people can also discover their invisible power and I start taking the initiative to explore more potential and expand my knowledge by jumping out of my comfort zone. Now I am comfortable taking challenges in unfamiliar areas and have discovered more unique advantages of myself, which will also benefit my career in finance as I feel excited to explore different sectors and emerging companies. Although I may not study for a PhD in finance, I’ll continue researching on the economy and market, which I believe will not disappoint my teacher.

## Changes brought by the pandemic

- If I were to achieve something or receive a prestigious award, I used to want it to be for my outstanding results on investment as I have an earnest ambition in investment and a great success or a prestigious award will be a great proof of my expertise. But the outbreak of pandemic has deeply changed my mindset, and given this question now, I would want it for the social impact I make instead of personal excellence. 
- When I was 13, I was fascinated by the magic realism of García Márquez and I wrote a short story of that genre called “My 2012”. At that time, many people believed in the Mayan apocalypse. In my story, I depicted the scenes of the end of the world I imagined. Instead of the disasters such as earthquakes, the eruption of volcanos and extreme weather as described in Book of Revelations, I assumed that there was an invisible virus flowing in the air, in order to survive, people have to live in special cubicles alone all their life. The cruelest revenge of earth would not be the physical ruin of our habitats, but a slow and lasting process of disconnecting people, which are born to live in groups. In the end, people gradually become unable to tolerate this kind of loneliness and commit suicide. And with the death of the last human, the earth gradually come back to life as if human beings never appeared before. 
- I never thought that 8 years later we would really be stuck in similar situations with various disasters at the same time. I was shocked by the emergence of coronavirus, Australian bushfires, Fukushima accident, locust plague in Africa, and droughts in California. The series of environment changes are essential reminders for us to pay attention to protecting our earth. Under the pandemic, poverty and inequality of wealth also seems to be worsening. 
- At this moment, I deeply feel a sense of mission to make a difference leveraging on my advantages. Combined the belief of contributing to a better society and the passion for a career in investment, I make up my mind to be a responsible investor and hope my future investment can generate a positive social impact and facilitate a more rational resource allocation. I no longer regard investment as a career or an intellectual competition, but my approach to connect with this world and the way how I make an impact. I sincerely hope the return of my investment would not only be an exceptional number, but also less pollutions, faster connections, and a better future.
